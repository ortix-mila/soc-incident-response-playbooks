**ID:** SOC-PB-003
**Tactic:** Credential Access
**MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:** [T1110 - Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/)

## Overview
This playbook details the response process for a brute force attack, where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to an account by systematically guessing passwords. The primary goals are to block the attack, verify account integrity, and strengthen preventative controls.

### Severity Levels
* **Low:** Unsuccessful brute force attempt against a non-critical, single account.
* **Medium:** Unsuccessful brute force attempt against multiple accounts or a privileged account.
* **High:** A brute force attempt has resulted in a successful login to any account.
