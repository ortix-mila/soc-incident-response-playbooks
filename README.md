# SOC Incident Response Playbooks

Welcome to the SOC Incident Response Playbook repository! This project provides a collection of standardized playbooks to help Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts and incident responders handle common security threats effectively and consistently.

## Overview

In a fast-paced SOC environment, having clear, actionable, and repeatable processes is crucial for minimizing the impact of security incidents. These playbooks serve as step-by-step guides for incident response, covering everything from initial detection to post-incident recovery.

### Purpose of SOC Playbooks
* **Standardization:** Ensure every analyst follows the same high-quality procedure for a given incident type.
* **Efficiency:** Reduce response times by providing clear steps and decision points, eliminating guesswork.
* **Training:** Act as a valuable training tool for new SOC analysts.
* **Automation:** Identify and implement opportunities for automation using SOAR (Security Orchestration,Automation, and Response) platforms.

### How to Use These Playbooks
1.  **During an Incident:** When an alert triggers, identify the corresponding playbook (e.g., a phishing alert maps to the `phishing-playbook.md`).
2.  **Follow the Steps:** Execute the steps outlined in the playbook, from detection and investigation to containment and recovery.
3.  **Leverage Automation:** Use the provided automation scripts and examples to accelerate response actions. The âš¡ icon indicates an automated step, while ðŸ‘¨ indicates a manual analyst action.
4.  **Contribute:** Use the `playbook_template.md` to create new playbooks for other incident types and contribute them to the repository.

### Integration with SIEM/SOAR Tools
These playbooks are designed to be platform-agnostic but can be easily integrated into your existing security tools:
* **SIEM (e.g., Splunk, QRadar, Microsoft Sentinel):** Use the detection and investigation steps to build correlation searches and alert dashboards.
* **SOAR (e.g., Splunk SOAR, Cortex XSOAR, Palo Alto XSOAR):** Implement the playbook logic and automation scripts as automated workflows to handle alerts with minimal human intervention. The YAML files in `automation_scripts/soar_examples/` provide a conceptual basis for this.
