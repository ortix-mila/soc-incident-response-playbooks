# Data Exfiltration Incident Response Playbook

**ID:** SOC-PB-004
**Tactic:** Exfiltration
**MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:** [T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041/), [T1567 - Exfiltration Over Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/)

## Overview
This playbook addresses incidents involving the unauthorized transfer of data from inside the network to an external location. The primary goals are to immediately stop the data loss, determine the scope of the breach, and recover the affected systems.

### Severity Levels
* **Low:** A small amount of non-sensitive data was exfiltrated from a low-value asset.
* **Medium:** Sensitive but non-regulated data (e.g., internal documents) was exfiltrated, or a large volume of non-sensitive data.
* **High:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), financial data, or intellectual property was exfiltrated. This is a critical breach.
